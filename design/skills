Soul skills:
  Souls don't really have skills persay; they have abilities and a couple values
  which may be improved by directly spending soul points.  They also have
  aspects, which require quest completion & such to improve.  And of course,
  souls have levels.

  Level:
    The type of soul it is; broken, normal, sensitive, mage.
    -Your level caps your abilities, restricts some entirely,
    -Upgrading requires a large expenditure of SP and a ritual, which itself
     may require special items, a particular location, and/or help from a third
     party.

  Values:
    Power Pool: The maximum PP you can have
      -The cost of increasing your power pool grows exponentially, to prevent
       absurdly high levels.  e.g. start with 30; 1 SP gains 10, then 9, 8, 7,
       etc.; after 1 SP = 1 PP we can start charging more than 1 SP per PP
    Shell: Your resistance to soul abilities; at high levels, this decreases
           the power of your abilities, too.  Each level of Shell makes training
           Empathy much harder.
      -This can be increased or decreased.  Neutral characters get the decrease
       for half price, Good characters get it for free (though it takes a couple
       turns, and they'll have to pay to increase it again).
    Empathy: Your ability to connect to other people.  This skill will help you
             understand their needs, detect lies and tell lies.  It will also
             make some spells more effective (???)  Each level of Empathy makes
             training Shell much harder.
      -Like Shell, this can be increased or decreased, with the same alignment-
       based costs.

  Abilities:
    Any of your "spells" go here.  Their power level can be increased via direct
    expenditure of SP.  Once increased, their power level cannot be decreased.
    The level they can be increased to is limited by your Aspects and Level.

  Aspects:
    "Schools" of "magic."  Initially you start with none of these.  As you
    complete quests, receive teaching, etc., you increase a "max level" in
    certain aspects.  You can spend SP to increase an aspect, but never beyond
    its max level.  You can also decrease aspects; Evil characters must spend SP
    to do so, Neutral characters do so for free, and Good characters receive 1/2
    the SP cost of increasing it.
    -The cost in SP of increasing an aspect is relatively high, as it benefits a
     wide range of Abilities.  This cost increases as the level of the aspect
     increases; it also increases with the level of other aspects.  It's cheaper
     to bring one aspect to level 6 than two to level 3.
    -Aspects may have more subtle effects than enhancing Abilities; for instance
     they may affect how terrain is generated around the player.  They could
     also change some rules of character progression; e.g. "Morphic" aspect
     might permit "selling back" soul upgrades

Body Skills:
  These are improved by spending XP on them directly, at will.  While SP is
  gained primarily through completing missions, spiritual growth, or predation,
  XP is gained directly by defeating enemies (or completing tasks which have
  some risk associated?).
  -The cost of raising a skill is dependant solely upon the current level of
   that skill.

  Combat:
  -Fighting: This applies to all types of melee combat, providing a small boost.
    Attack types: All weapons use one, two or three types of attacks.  Training
                  in an attack type improves your ability with weapons that use
                  that type; when attacking with a weapon with more than one
                  attack type, both have their damage calculated (using the same
                  roll) and the best is used.
    -Slashing:    Enemy gets dodge malus
    -Stabbing:    Damage bonus against fast movers
    -Bludgeoning: Enemy gets AC malus
    Techniques: New techniques are gained by learning them from a teacher, and
                their effectiveness scales with higher levels.  These can all be
                toggled on & off, much like soul enchantments are.
    -Fury: This increases the speed and damage of your attacks, but decreases
           dodge & parry abilities.
    -Sweep: If applicable, you'll make attack attempts on all adjacent enemies
            when you attack.  Each attack attempt beyong the first costs half
            the movement points of the previous attack (so, 50%, 25%, 12%, etc)
    -Knockback: A hit may knock the target back a tile (or more, depending on
                your strength:size ratio; very effective against flyers)

  -Ranged: Applies to all ranged weapons.
    -Snipe: This increases the damage done on a critical hit.
    -Burst: This increases your firing speed.

  Defense:
  -Dodge: Your ability to dodge attacks.
  -Parry: Your ability to block attacks, with a weapon or shield.

  ?Do we want a "light weapons"/"Heavy weapons" skill? Since all weapons have a
   light & heavy version...

  Non-Combat:  Those with a * are boosted by Empathy (soul skill)
  *Music: Your ability to play musical instruments.  This includes magical and
          enchanted instruments, as well as more mundane ones.
          boosted by soul level.
  *Barter: Your ability to get a better deal when buying things.  This will
           reduce costs towards equity
  -Sneak: Your ability to sneak around without being detected
  -Logic: Mathematics, finances, etc.
  -Chemistry: Include alchemy, etc
