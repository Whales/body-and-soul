Weapons have a speed, accuracy, and damage, and each class has two kinds:
They also have a handedness; 1H is fine with one arm, /H suffers penalties to
 all stats with one arm, 2H is unusable with one arm.
They also have a primary stat orientation; Dex or Str.  The time is reduced by
 some scale based on that stat (and likely based on the original Time; i.e.
 Times above 10 are easier to reduce)

Soul Egg
  Any mundane item (or weapon) (or armor) may be a soul egg--an item into which
  a slice of one's soul has been placed.  This may be achieved through the high-
  level (and SP-costing) power Create Soul Egg.
  The item gains one or more of the soul's powers, and its Shell and Power Pts
  properties.  It also holds one or more SP.
  Creating a soul egg costs 1 + X SP.  The resulting egg has X * .8 SP
