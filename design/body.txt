Bodies have special properties; generally these only belong to living beings,
but ghosts may cast Substantiate to gain a body temporarily.

Bodies are composed of parts.  Parts all have HP 100, and a stat or two.
The value of the stat is multiplied by the % of HP remaining.

Parts:
  Head:
    Stat Intelligence
      Reason
      Persuade
    Stat Perception
      Notice
      Target
  Arm:
    Stat Strength
      Push
      Strike (damage)
    Stat Dexterity
      Block
      Strike (hit)
  Torso:
    Stat Strength
      Lift
    Stat Endurance
      Resist
  Leg:
    Stat Strength
      Kick (damage)
      Run
    Stat Dexterity
      Dodge
      Kick (hit)
      Dance

Body Examples:
  Spirit - This is a "pseudobody" and is not presented as such in-game.  It does
           not follow the usual rules of a body; e.g. it cannot be hit with most
           physical attacks.  It houses the stats that a bodiless soul uses.
    Head:
      Perception = Per As Human * 0.9
      Intelligence = Int As Human * 1.1

  Human - This is what all characters start with.
    Head:
      Per 8-12
      Int 8-12
    Torso:
      Str 8-12
      End 8-12
    Arm (left):
    Arm (right):
      Str 8-12
      Dex 8-12
      Non-dominant side receives Str-2, Dex-4 (unless Ambidextrous)
    Leg (left):
    Leg (right):
      Str 8-12
      Dex 8-12


Spirit Bodies:  Spirits can assume one of these using the "Substantiate" spell
                Spirit bodies may have "special attacks" on any body part
                When a range is given for a stat, it is affected by the spirit's
                appropriate skill
